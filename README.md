# DCP-Test-Generator
The dcp-test-generator generates from a dcp slave description a graph containing test cases which tests a dcp slave implmementation. The generated file can then be used by the DCP-Tester to execute the tests. 

Take a look at [test-coverage](wiki) to see which parts of the dcp protocol will be tested.
